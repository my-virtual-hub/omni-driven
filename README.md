# Omni Drivers (Applications)

The "omni-driven" module serves as the infrastructure layer within the Omni project, focusing on providing essential support and resources for the overall system operation. This module plays a foundational role in facilitating communication and interaction between the application and external systems, ensuring seamless integration and interoperability.

Within the "omni-driven" module, the primary objective is to manage external dependencies, including databases, external services, and communication protocols. It encapsulates infrastructure-related concerns such as data access, configuration management, and communication protocols, abstracting them from the core application logic.

In summary, the "omni-driven" module serves as the backbone of the Omni project's infrastructure layer, providing a robust and scalable foundation for the entire system. Its design and implementation are crucial for ensuring the reliability, performance, and maintainability of the system, enabling seamless integration with external systems and efficient operation in diverse environments.
